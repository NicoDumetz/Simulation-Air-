My Radar

My Radar is a terminal-based air traffic simulation program written in C. It renders a 2D visualization panel showing a simulation of air traffic, including aircraft and control towers.
Requirements

MUST:

    Take exactly one parameter.
    Accept any filepath as an argument corresponding to the file containing the simulation script.
    Display error message if the script is not found or incorrect.
    Window size must be 1920x1080 pixels.
    Close the window using events.
    Display aircrafts’ hitbox and control towers’ areas.
    Manage as many displayed entities as possible.

SHOULD:

    Display and update a timer in seconds at the top-right corner of the window.
    Stop once all aircrafts have landed or been destroyed.
    Allow aircrafts to take off after a given delay.
    Display aircrafts and control towers using sprites.
    Accept the “-h” option to display the usage.
    Switch visibility of hitboxes and areas by pressing the key ‘L’.
    Switch visibility of entities’ sprites by pressing the key ‘S’.
    Display user interactions in the usage.

COULD:

    Implement advanced features such as 3D space for aircrafts, rotational hitboxes, wrap-around screen, etc.

Script

The script file contains all the information about the simulation and the entities. Aircrafts and control towers are described with specific formats and separated by newlines. See the example below:

plaintext

A 815 321 1484 166 5 0
A 1589 836 811 936 2 0
A 202 894 103 34 3 0
T 93 47 19
T 49 56 25

Usage

bash

$ ./my_radar path_to_script

bash

$ ./my_radar -h

User Interactions

    Press ‘L’ key to enable/disable hitboxes and areas.
    Press ‘S’ key to enable/disable sprites.

Compilation

Compile using Makefile:

bash

$ make

Error Handling

    Error messages are displayed if arguments are incorrect.
    The program exits with error code 84 if an error occurs.
